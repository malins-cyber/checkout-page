## Overview

![screenshot](./public/images/desktop-version.png)

Main challage was to build a check out page for an ecommerce and make it reponsive 
depending on the users screen viewport:

- main demo can be found on my main github page or here[].
- The whole design taugh me how to use flexbox and grids together.
to make the design pop it made it a good challenge to flex off my skills.
- This design over all taught me to hanace the power of flexbox and css grids.
- css grids is the future:)
